Your task:

Define a base class Vehicle with properties like Speed (int) and a method Drive() that outputs text.

Create two derived classes: Car and Bicycle, which inherit from Vehicle.

Override the Drive() method in the subclasses with specific behavior (e.g., "The car is driving at X km/h").

Define an interface IHorn with a method Horn().

Implement the interface in Car, where Horn() outputs a horn sound, and optionally in Bicycle.


Notes:
- Properties are special members that look like fields from the outside but internally have methods to get and/or set values.
- They provide a controlled way to access private fields.
